# Documentation Templates

Companion file for the `pitchdocs-suite` skill. Load this file when generating specific documentation files from the inventory.

> **Content filter awareness:** Claude Code's API has a content filtering system that can block output (HTTP 400) when generating standard OSS files containing governance language, security terminology, or verbatim legal text. For each template below, follow the noted generation strategy. See the `docs-writer` agent for the full mitigation playbook.

## CONTRIBUTING.md

**Content filter note:** This template is lengthy. If the content filter blocks generation, write it in chunks:
1. Write the header and "Quick Links" section first
2. Add "Development Setup" section
3. Add "How to Contribute" section (reporting bugs, suggesting features, submitting code)
4. Add "Commit Messages" and "Code Review" sections last

The template below is a reference — adapt it to the project's actual workflow rather than reproducing it verbatim.

```markdown
# Contributing to [Project Name]

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Quick Links

- [Open Issues](link) — Find something to work on
- [Good First Issues](link) — Perfect for new contributors
- [Discussion Forum](link) — Ask questions, propose ideas

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Runtime] version [X]+
- [Package manager]

### Getting Started

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/org/repo.git
cd repo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests to verify setup
npm test

# Start development
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Search [existing issues](link) to avoid duplicates
2. Use the [bug report template](link)
3. Include: what you expected, what happened, steps to reproduce

### Suggesting Features

1. Check the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) — it might already be planned
2. Open a [feature request](link)
3. Describe the problem you're solving, not just the solution you want

### Submitting Code

1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Write your code and tests
3. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
4. Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
5. Commit using [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/): `feat: add thing`
6. Push and open a pull request

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat: add new feature` — New functionality
- `fix: resolve bug` — Bug fix
- `docs: update readme` — Documentation only
- `test: add tests` — Test additions
- `refactor: restructure code` — Code change that doesn't fix a bug or add a feature
- `chore: update deps` — Maintenance tasks

### Code Review

All submissions require review. We aim to review PRs within 48 hours. We may suggest changes, improvements, or alternatives.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

Thank you for making [Project Name] better!
```

## CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

**Content filter note:** This file contains governance language that triggers Claude Code's content filter when generated inline. Always fetch from the canonical URL rather than writing from scratch.

**Generation method — fetch and customise:**

```bash
# Download Contributor Covenant v3.0
curl -sL "https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md" -o CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

After fetching, use Edit tool to replace these placeholders:
- `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` — project contact email or reporting URL
- Verify the "Enforcement" section matches the project's governance structure

**Why v3.0:** Clearer language, less US-centric phrasing, "Addressing and Repairing Harm" section aligned with restorative justice principles. Always use v3.0 for new projects.

**Fallback:** If the URL is unreachable, direct the user to https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/ and ask them to download manually.

## SECURITY.md

**Content filter note:** Security policy files contain vulnerability/exploit keywords that can trigger Claude Code's content filter. Fetch a template and customise rather than generating from scratch.

**Generation method — fetch and customise:**

```bash
# Option 1: GitHub's own security policy (needs heavy customisation — replace all GitHub-specific references)
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/.github/main/SECURITY.md" -o SECURITY.md

# Option 2: If Option 1 fails, create a minimal starter file
cat > SECURITY.md << 'SECEOF'
# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via [GitHub Security Advisories](link/security/advisories/new).
SECEOF
```

After fetching or creating the starter file, use Edit tool to customise in small chunks:

1. **Supported versions table** — add the project's version support matrix
2. **Reporting method** — replace with project-specific email or GitHub Security Advisories URL (`https://github.com/org/repo/security/advisories/new`)
3. **Response timeline** — set acknowledgement (48h), assessment (1 week), and fix timelines
4. **Disclosure policy** — add coordinated disclosure statement

**Required sections** (ensure all are present after customisation):
- Supported Versions (table with version and support status)
- Reporting a Vulnerability (contact method, what to include)
- Response Timeline (acknowledgement, assessment, fix timelines)
- Disclosure Policy (coordinated disclosure)
- Security Updates (reference to CHANGELOG.md)
