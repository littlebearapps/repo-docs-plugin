# AI Context File Generator

## Philosophy

AI coding assistants work better when they understand a project's conventions, architecture, and constraints. Context files tell AI tools **how** to work with the codebase — coding standards, test patterns, import conventions, key file paths, and deployment workflows.

This skill generates context files for multiple AI tools from a single codebase analysis. The same scan produces output for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI.

## Supported Context Files

| File | AI Tool | Purpose | Adoption |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Claude Code | Cross-tool agent context — identity, capabilities, conventions | 40,000+ repos |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code | Project-specific instructions loaded on every session | Native to Claude Code |
| `.cursorrules` | Cursor | Editor-specific rules for code generation | Native to Cursor |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot | Repository-level instructions for Copilot suggestions | Native to Copilot |
| `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf | Project-specific rules for Windsurf's Cascade AI | Native to Windsurf |
| `.clinerules` | Cline (VS Code extension) | Project context for autonomous Cline tasks | Native to Cline |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI | Project context loaded at the start of every Gemini CLI session | Native to Gemini CLI |

### CLAUDE.md vs Auto-Memory (Claude Code)

Claude Code maintains three knowledge layers. PitchDocs generates CLAUDE.md — never MEMORY.md.

| Layer | File | Who Writes | Shared via Git? |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Project instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | Developer / PitchDocs | Yes |
| Auto-memory | `~/.claude/.../MEMORY.md` | Claude itself | No (local only) |
| Session memory | (in-context) | Claude itself | No |

**Boundary rule:** CLAUDE.md contains instructions *for* Claude. MEMORY.md contains notes *by* Claude. If the same insight keeps appearing in MEMORY.md across sessions, promote it to CLAUDE.md.

## Codebase Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Project Profile

```bash
# Language and runtime
ls package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml build.gradle 2>/dev/null

# Framework detection
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"(react|next|express|fastify|hono|astro|svelte)"'
cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | grep -E '(fastapi|django|flask|starlette)'

# Test runner
ls jest.config* vitest.config* pytest.ini pyproject.toml .mocharc* 2>/dev/null
grep -l "test" package.json 2>/dev/null

# Linter/formatter
ls .eslintrc* eslint.config* .prettierrc* biome.json ruff.toml .flake8 2>/dev/null

# TypeScript configuration
ls tsconfig*.json 2>/dev/null

# Monorepo detection
ls pnpm-workspace.yaml lerna.json nx.json turbo.json 2>/dev/null

# CI/CD
ls .github/workflows/*.yml 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Extract Conventions

From the codebase analysis, extract:

1. **Language version** — Node.js version from `.nvmrc`/`engines`, Python from `requires-python`, Go from `go.mod`
2. **Import conventions** — ESM vs CommonJS, absolute vs relative imports, path aliases (`@/`)
3. **Naming patterns** — camelCase/snake_case for variables, PascalCase for types, file naming
4. **Directory structure** — where source, tests, config, and docs live
5. **Test patterns** — test file location (`__tests__/`, `*.test.ts`, `tests/`), test runner, assertion style
6. **Build/deploy** — build command, deploy target (Cloudflare, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
7. **Error handling** — custom error classes, Result types, try-catch patterns
8. **Security rules** — .gitignore patterns, secret management, input validation

### Step 3: Generate Context Files

#### AGENTS.md Structure

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Identity

[Project name] is a [brief description]. Built with [language/framework].

## Project Structure

```
[Key directories and their purpose]
```

## Coding Conventions

- [Language]: [version]
- Style: [naming conventions, import order]
- Types: [strict mode, no any, explicit returns — if TypeScript]
- Tests: [runner, location, naming pattern]
- Commits: [conventional commits, branch naming]

## Key Commands

```bash
[install command]
[test command]
[build command]
[lint command]
[deploy command]
```

## Architecture

[2-3 sentences on architecture: patterns used, key abstractions, data flow]

## Important Files

- [key config file] — [purpose]
- [main entry point] — [purpose]
- [key module] — [purpose]

## Rules

- [Critical rule 1 — e.g., never commit secrets]
- [Critical rule 2 — e.g., all public functions need tests]
- [Critical rule 3 — e.g., use direnv exec for deploy commands]
```

#### CLAUDE.md Structure

Claude Code loads this file at the start of every session. Keep it concise — under 200 lines.

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Quick Reference

- **Language**: [X] with [framework]
- **Test**: `[test command]`
- **Build**: `[build command]`
- **Deploy**: `[deploy command]`

## Coding Standards

[3-5 bullet points on the most important conventions]

## Architecture

[Key patterns, file organisation, data flow — 3-5 bullet points]

## Key Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | Source code |
| `tests/` | Test files |
| ... | ... |

## Rules

[Critical do/don't rules that prevent common mistakes]
```

#### .cursorrules Structure

Cursor rules are plain text, loaded when editing files in the project.

```
You are working on [project name], a [description].

Language: [X] with [framework]
Style: [conventions]

Key rules:
- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]
- [Rule 3]

When writing code:
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

When writing tests:
- [Test pattern 1]
- [Test pattern 2]

File structure:
- src/ — source code
- tests/ — test files
```

#### .github/copilot-instructions.md Structure

```markdown
# Copilot Instructions

## Project Context

This is a [description] built with [language/framework].

## Coding Standards

- [Convention 1]
- [Convention 2]
- [Convention 3]

## Patterns to Follow

- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

## Patterns to Avoid

- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]
```

#### .windsurfrules Structure

Windsurf's Cascade AI reads `.windsurfrules` from the project root. Format is plain text — similar to `.cursorrules`. Windsurf supports both global (`~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md`) and project-level rules.

```
# [Project Name] — Windsurf Rules

## Project Context

[Project name] is a [description]. Built with [language/framework].

## Coding Standards

- [Convention 1]
- [Convention 2]
- [Convention 3]

## Key Files

- [main entry] — [purpose]
- [config file] — [purpose]

## Commands

[test command]
[build command]
[deploy command]

## Rules

- [Critical rule 1]
- [Critical rule 2]
```

#### .clinerules Structure

Cline reads `.clinerules` from the project root. It supports a richer format than `.cursorrules` including task checklists.

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Project Overview

[1-2 sentence description of what the project is and does]

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: [X]
- **Framework**: [Y]
- **Test runner**: [Z]
- **Linter**: [W]

## Coding Standards

- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]
- [Rule 3]

## Important Paths

- `[path]` — [purpose]

## Before Committing

- [ ] Tests pass (`[test command]`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`[lint command]`)
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in changed files
```

#### GEMINI.md Structure

Gemini CLI reads `GEMINI.md` from the project root (or `.gemini/GEMINI.md`). Keep it concise — Gemini CLI's context window handling differs from Claude Code.

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One sentence: what is this project and who is it for]

## Tech Stack

[Language], [Framework], [Key dependencies]

## Commands

[test command]
[build command]
[deploy command]

## Conventions

- [Convention 1]
- [Convention 2]
- [Convention 3]

## Key Paths

- `[path]`: [purpose]
```

## Staleness Audit

When running in `audit` mode, check existing context files for drift:

1. **Version mismatch** — Does the context file reference the correct language/framework version?
2. **Missing commands** — Are test/build/deploy commands still accurate? Run them to verify.
3. **Stale paths** — Do referenced file paths still exist?
4. **New conventions** — Has the project adopted new patterns (e.g., added ESLint, switched to Vitest) that aren't reflected?
5. **Memory drift** — If a MEMORY.md exists for this project, check whether it records conventions or patterns that should be promoted to CLAUDE.md. Flag as `ℹ MEMORY.md contains project conventions that may belong in CLAUDE.md`.

Report format:
```
AI Context Audit:
  ✓ AGENTS.md — up to date (last modified: 2 days ago)
  ⚠ CLAUDE.md — references jest but vitest.config.ts detected
  ✗ .cursorrules — references src/index.ts but file moved to src/main.ts
  · .github/copilot-instructions.md — not present
  · .windsurfrules — not present (recommend generating)
  · .clinerules — not present (recommend generating)
  · GEMINI.md — not present (recommend generating)
```

## AGENTS.md Spec Version Tracking

The AGENTS.md format is defined by the [agents.md spec](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md). PitchDocs tracks the pinned version in `upstream-versions.json`.

### Current Stable: v1.0

The v1.0 spec defines these standard sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Identity | Project name, description, what it does |
| Project Structure | Key directories and their purposes |
| Conventions | Coding standards, naming, commit conventions |
| Commands | Test, build, deploy, lint commands |
| Architecture | System design, data flow, key abstractions |
| Files | Important files and their roles |
| Rules | Hard constraints (security, compatibility) |

### Proposed v1.1 Features (Draft — Do Not Implement)

These features are under discussion and may change before stabilisation:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Sub-agents section | Draft | Nested agent definitions within AGENTS.md |
| Tool permissions | Proposed | Declaring which tools an agent can use |
| `.agent/` directory | Proposed | Directory-based agent definitions (alternative to single file) |
| `when:` frontmatter | Draft | Trigger conditions for agent activation |

**Guidance:** Do not generate these proposed sections until they reach stable status. Monitor the [agents.md releases](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/releases) for v1.1 announcement. The `check-upstream` GitHub Action will flag when a new version is available. When v1.1 reaches stable, update the pinned version in `upstream-versions.json` and add the new sections to the generation templates above.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't dump entire codebase** — context files should be concise summaries, not file listings
- **Don't include secrets** — no API keys, tokens, or credentials in context files
- **Don't repeat framework docs** — reference framework conventions, don't reproduce them
- **Don't over-constrain** — provide patterns, not rigid rules that prevent creative problem-solving
- **Don't include session-specific state** — context files should be durable across sessions
